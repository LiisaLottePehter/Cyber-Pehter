Summary

My experience with this topic has been overall good and I really like the process of making different spring boot applications. From this project I learned how to do state transitions because I haven't used them before.
It was a little bit confusing in the beginning but after reading the documentation and some articles it became more clear to me. I also encountered problems with IntelliJ for some reason and fixing that took some time.
In summary I really enjoyed working with this project and think it was valuable for me.
